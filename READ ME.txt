Files
--------------------------------
1) Run: Just runs the game, nothing special.
2) collisions: All the code required to check for polygon collisions
3) data: Contains polygon data (points) and some functions to create polygons.
4) smart: Contains the smartObject and bullet classes. These can draw themselves, check for collisions and more.
5) geometry: This is like a math library.
6) main: This is where all the game code is. It creates the canvas, all the objects and all that stuff.
7) READ ME: This file, obviously.


Instructions
--------------------------------
Arrow keys to move around (down slows you down instead of going back)
Space to shoot
P to pause

Goal: Destroying polygons.
Hint: You are the red isosceles triangle


Some Information
--------------------------------
Pentagons will start to appear after your score goes above 250 (its easy but I didn't want them to come really early).

All the shapes (except the first four squares) are created randomly. The chances of their being created increases with your score. There is a tiny chance (1 in a trillion squared ??) that you wil only see four squares. I canot do anything about it.


Cheat Codes
--------------------------------
There are none. I have neither the time nor the confidence.


Personal Note
--------------------------------
If you can go above 3000 without cheating (and within 4 years), please e-mail me.


Algoritms
--------------------------------
I took most of them from the internet. They are widely used algoritms and they are everywhere. I wrote all the Python code myself though.
